- We note down the time when all leads for property take the first tour within a specific time frame. (Time of initial tour)
- We record when an application is submitted by these leads. (Time of application)
- For each lead, we calculate the Toured to Applied Duration by taking the difference between the time of application and the time of the initial tour (in days).
