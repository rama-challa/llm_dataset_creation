- We note down the time when all leads for a property are created within a specific time frame. (Time of contact creation)
- We record when the first tour is taken by these leads. (Time of the initial tour)
- For each lead, we calculate the Lead to Toured Duration by taking the difference between the time of initial tour and the time of contact creation (in days).
- From this range of time differences, we identify the value at the 75th percentile. This value represents the Lead to Toured Duration for the property."

- There are 8 properties in a PMCs (Pr1 Pr2, Pr3, Pr4, Pr5, Pr6, Pr7, and Pr8) with average conversion durations of 8.0, 10.0 12.0, 14.0, 16.0, 18.0, 20.0 and 22.0 days respectively for the month of January.
-  The 25th percentile value for this property distribution is 10.0 days.
- The 75th percentile value is 18.0 days.
- The benchmark is 10.0 to 18.0 days.
- The performance of Pr2, Pr3, Pr4, Pr5 and Pr6 are satisfactory as they lie within the range.
- Performance of Pr7 and Pr8 is not satisfactory (20.0 and 22.0 days > benchmark range)
- Performance of Pr1 exceeds expectations.  (8.0 days < benchmark range) "
